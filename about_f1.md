Formula 1 (F1) is the premier category of global motorsport. Organized each year under the authority of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), it is a world championship that brings together the best drivers, cars, and teams from around the globe. Since its official inception in 1950, F1 has combined technological innovation, race strategy, and athletic performance at an unparalleled level.

Each Formula 1 season consists of a series of Grand Prix races held on different circuits around the world (urban, permanent, or mixed). The annual calendar typically includes between 20 and 24 races. Each Grand Prix offers drivers and teams (also referred to as constructors) the opportunity to earn points based on their performance.

Drivers are the athletes who operate the single-seater cars. Each team usually fields two drivers per season. Teams are responsible for the design, development, and management of their cars. Some teams are full-fledged constructors (like Ferrari or Mercedes), while others may use engines supplied by third-party manufacturers.

The competition is structured around two parallel championships:

- the Drivers' World Championship, awarded to the driver who accumulates the most points by the end of the season.

- the Constructors' World Championship, awarded to the team whose two drivers earn the most combined points.

A typical Grand Prix weekend is composed of several stages:

- free practice sessions, which allow teams to test car setups.

- qualifying sessions, which determine the starting grid position. These are held in three knockout rounds (Q1, Q2, Q3), where drivers aim to set the fastest possible time.

- the main race (Grand Prix), usually held on Sunday, where points are awarded to the top ten finishers according to a standard scoring system (25 points for the winner, 18 for second place, etc.).

In recent seasons, some weekends also feature a sprint race, a short-format race that influences the starting grid for the main race and offers additional points.

F1 is therefore a discipline where mechanical performance, human skill, team strategy, and risk management are deeply interconnected. This complex and data-rich environment makes it especially suitable for data analysis aimed at understanding driver behavior and performance factors.
